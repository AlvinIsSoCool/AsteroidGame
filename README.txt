Asteroid Game (By Alvin Alexander)
=========================================
This is a simple game made in python using pygame.

How to Run
==========
To run the game, you need python and the pygame package to be installed.

To install pygame, use the following command:
-> pip install pygame OR python -m pip install pygame

NOTE: Skip installation of python, if it is already installed. 
              Skip the above step, if pygame is installed.

Once python and pygame is installed, 

Use the following command to run the game:
-> python main.py

Or: double-click the main.py file or right-click and execute.

How to Play
==========
To play the game, use the WASD or Arrow Keys to control the triangle, which is the
player. Press SPACE or the LEFT or RIGHT Mouse Buttons to shoot tiny square bullets.

The aim of the game is to survive with limited lives and/or to get as high of a score 
as possible by shooting the asteroids (reddish-brown circles). 
The big asteroid grants 20 points and the small one grants 10 points.

Difficulty will progress slowly as you play the game. Some settings can be tweaked by 
checking settings.py. Every option will be documented in it.

Good Luck, Player, and most importantly, have fun!
